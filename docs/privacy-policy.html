        <h1>Privacy Policy for Pockets Chrome Extension</h1>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how the Pockets Chrome Extension
            ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your
            information when you use our link-saving extension.
        </p>

        <p>
            By using the Pockets extension, you agree to the collection and use
            of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions We Use</h2>

        <p>
            The Pockets extension requires certain permissions to function
            properly. Below is a detailed explanation of each permission and why
            it is needed:
        </p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
            We use the <strong>storage</strong> permission to save your links
            locally in your browser. This allows you to access your saved links
            across browser sessions. All data is stored locally on your device
            and is never transmitted to external servers.
        </p>

        <h3>ActiveTab</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>activeTab</strong> permission allows the extension to
            access information about the currently active tab when you interact
            with the extension. This is used to retrieve the URL and title of
            the page you want to save. This permission only activates when you
            explicitly use the extension and does not allow background access to
            your browsing activity.
        </p>

        <h3>Context Menus</h3>
        <p>
            We use the <strong>contextMenus</strong> permission to add a "Save
            to Pockets" option to your right-click menu. This provides a
            convenient way to save links directly from any webpage without
            opening the extension popup.
        </p>

        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>notifications</strong> permission is used to display
            browser notifications when a link is successfully saved or when
            there are important updates. You can disable these notifications in
            your browser settings at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>scripting</strong> permission allows the extension to
            execute scripts on web pages when you choose to save a link. This is
            used to extract relevant information such as the page title and URL
            for your saved links. Scripts are only executed when you explicitly
            trigger the save action.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>
            The Pockets extension collects and stores the following information
            locally on your device:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>URLs of links you choose to save</li>
            <li>Page titles of saved links</li>
            <li>Date and time when links are saved</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong
                >We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information
                on external servers.</strong
            >
            All your saved links remain on your local device.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>
            All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API. Your saved
            links are only accessible to you and are not shared with any third
            parties. We do not have access to your saved links or browsing
            history.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>
            The Pockets extension does not integrate with or share data with any
            third-party services. Your data remains entirely on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                You can view all your saved links at any time through the
                extension
            </li>
            <li>You can delete individual links or all saved links</li>
            <li>
                Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>
            The Pockets extension is not intended for children under the age of
            13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from
            children.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes
            will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. We
            encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
            changes.
        </p>
